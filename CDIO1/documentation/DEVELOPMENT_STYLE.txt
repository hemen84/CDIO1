//comments 
- if possible not writing comments, instead use descriptive names, the code is much more clear (see Screaming architecture) 

//general 
- always use { } even if only one line for example:
  
  if(isGoodToGo()){
    //one line 
  }else{
    //one line
  }
  
//UML
- use UML 2 and the agile style http://agilemodeling.com/ where needed
