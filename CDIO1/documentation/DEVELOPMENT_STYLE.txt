//test driven 
- do not write code before writing a failing test for it
- 

//commits
- remember to update before you commit and push
- push only one use case or functionality at a time
-

//comments 
- if possible not writing comments, instead use descriptive names, the code is much more clear (Screaming architecture) 
-

//general 
- always use { } even if only one line for example:
  
  if(isGoodToGo()){
    //one line 
  }else{
    //one line
  }
- 
  
//UML
- use UML 2 and the agile style http://agilemodeling.com/ where needed 
- remember to update UML when something changes
